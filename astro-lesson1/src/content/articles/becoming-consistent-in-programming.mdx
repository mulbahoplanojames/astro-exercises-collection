Consistency is the key to mastering programming. Here’s how you can build a routine that keeps you growing as a developer:

1. Set a Daily Practice Goal – Even 30–60 minutes of coding daily helps reinforce concepts and build muscle memory.

2. Work on Real Projects – Apply your knowledge by building small projects. Websites, automation scripts, and open-source contributions are great starting points.

3. Follow a Learning Plan – Structure your studies based on your goals, whether it’s web development, data science, or backend engineering.

4. Stay Accountable – Join coding communities, find a mentor, or participate in challenges like #100DaysOfCode.

5. Review & Refactor Code – Improving old code helps solidify concepts and enhances problem-solving skills.

6. Avoid Burnout – Consistency doesn’t mean overworking. Take breaks, enjoy the process, and maintain a balanced schedule.

The key is discipline over motivation. Small, steady improvements lead to long-term mastery.
