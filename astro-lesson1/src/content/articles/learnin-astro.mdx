Astro is a modern web framework designed for building fast, content-driven websites. If you're starting from scratch, here’s how to get up to speed:

1. Understand the Basics – Astro focuses on static site generation (SSG) but allows interactive components from React, Vue, and other frameworks. Read the official documentation to grasp the fundamentals.

2. Installation & Setup – Install Astro using:

```
npm create astro@latest
cd my-astro-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Learn Astro Components – Unlike React, Astro ships minimal JavaScript by default. Use .astro files to create static pages while embedding dynamic components when necessary.

4. Enhancing with Integrations – Astro supports Tailwind, MDX, and other tools for styling and content management.

5. Deploying Your Astro Site – You can deploy Astro sites easily on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

With its lightweight approach and partial hydration features, Astro is perfect for blogs, landing pages, and documentation sites.
